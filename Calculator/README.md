1. I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.

3. I can chain mathematical operations together.

#### Notes

A working demonstration can be found on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ManBearPigg/full/EKwbrZ/).

Please be mindful of the order of operations when chaining operations together.

Note that operators do not appear in the display. Negative numbers will not be marked "-".
